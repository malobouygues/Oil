## Project n°1:

**The Question**: Is the market structure incentivizing storage (Contango) or demanding immediate inventory release (Backwardation)?

**Objective**: To visualize the WTI Forward Curve dynamics. This tool moves beyond "Flat Price" to calculate the Implied Roll Yield, identifying the inventory incentives that drive physical flows at the Cushing hub.



## Project n°2:

**The Question**: Is the current physical tightness historically extreme (a 2-sigma event) or just nominal noise?

**Objective**: To model the WTI Prompt Spread (M1-M2) using a volume-based rolling algorithm. It applies Z-Score normalization to filter out volatility regimes and statistically confirm "Black Swan" scarcity signals (e.g., War, Pipeline outages).
